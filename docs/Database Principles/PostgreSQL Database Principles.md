For consistency across projects (although some of our older projects deviate slightly), we want the following principles adhered to when managing databases.

We are primarily a PostgreSQL shop, so these principles will apply most directly to that database architecture.

## Typical Table Structure
In order for our developers to jump between projects with some ease, we'd like to have the table structure as consistent as possible so they spend the time learning about the business and features of the app, and not the technical layout of the database.

## Function Principles
Functions are a great way to provide additional logic into the database to improve performance of some operations.
